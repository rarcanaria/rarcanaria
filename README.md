<h3>Hey, I'm Ronron 👋</h3>
<p>I'm a 21-year-old developer based in Qatar, and I have a deep curiosity for all things tech. Solving problems and learning new things is my passion.</p>
  
  - Check out some projects I've made in my Portfolio.
  - Visit my blog, where I will be logging my journey as a growing developer.
  - Stay updated with my LinkedIn.

<h2>🔍 Present Whereabouts</h2>
<p>I'm currently in college, but I'll be dabbling in minor projects from time to time in order to gain experience and expand my skillset.</p>

  - Right now, I'm making basic sites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - I plan on diving deeper into Python and JavaScript
  - I will be doing one major (relative) project each month for the muscle memory

<h2>✨ Interests</h2>

  - My dream car is the Porsche 918 Spyder.
  - I enjoy birdwatching. I have a lot of favorite birds, but right now it's the Golden Pheasant.
  - I also really like giant monsters and mechs. The classic Eva-01 will always be king.

<p>I'm currently not looking to collaborate on minor projects, but I plan to soon!</p>
