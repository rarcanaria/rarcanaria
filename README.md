<h3>Hey, I'm Ronron 👋</h3>
I'm a 21-year-old developer based in Qatar, and I have a deep curiosity for all things tech. Solving problems and learning things is my passion.

  
- Check out some projects I've made in my Portfolio.
- Visit my blog, where I will be logging my journey as a growing developer.
- Stay updated with my LinkedIn.

<h2>🔍 Present Whereabouts</h2>
I'm currently a college student in IT, but I'll be dabbling in minor projects from time to time in order to gain experience and expand my skillset.


- Right now, I'm making basic sites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I plan on diving deeper into Python and JavaScript
- I will be doing one major project each month to build muscle memory (hopefully)

<h2>🫂 Team Up with Me!</h2>
I'm looking to collaborate on minor projects, specifically fun little one-off games. Here's what I can offer:


- Graphics
- [Something]

<h2>👀 About me</h2>


- I'm a sucker for cars. My dream car is the Porsche 918 Spyder.
- I enjoy birdwatching. I have a lot of favorite birds, currently it's the Kingfisher.
- I also really like giant monsters/mechs. Godzilla will always be king, but aesthetic-wise, I think Eva-01 takes the cake.
